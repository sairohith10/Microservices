What are microservices?


Microservices are an architectural approach to building applications that are distributed and loosely coupled so that a change in one microservice wonâ€™t break the entire app. 

This lets development teams rapidly build new application components to meet changing business needs.

A microservice consists of a single deployment, isolated from other deployments and processes, that supports a specific business function. 

A collection of services constitutes a distributed system, where services consume and produce data for one another in the cloud.
